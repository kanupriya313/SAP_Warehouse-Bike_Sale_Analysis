# SAP Warehouse- Bike Sale Analysis
 It's incredibly rare in real-world data research to start with a perfect data set. Instead, data must typically be gathered from several sources and cleaned thoroughly before any analysis or modelling can be carried out. We'll walk over the first step of a data science project, which is acquiring raw data. The collecting, preparation, cleaning, and aggregation of data, as well as exploratory data analysis, will be the main focus of this project. Bikes Sale Sample data, which is a part of the SAP warehouse cloud content master data, will be used for this project. Also, we'll combine numerous messed datasets into a single clean dataset, before starting analysing.
